if you dont have pi-apps installed already then run these commands below #1. but if you do then go to #2.
#1. Installing pi-apps.
first run ```sudo apt install git``` then run ```git clone https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps``` then, ```~/pi-apps/install```

Run ```git clone https://github.com/robloxboy24/Bongo-Cat-Pi-Apps-Download && mv ~/Bongo-Cat-Pi-Apps-Download/install-32 ~/ && sudo chmod a+x ~/install-32 && ~/install-32```
